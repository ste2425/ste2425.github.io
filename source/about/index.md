Hi, my name is **Stephen Cooper**, hows things?

I'm a software engineer and I've been working with web-based technologies for going on ten years now.

I enjoy anything DIY, taking the car apart, taking the house apart, taking retro consoles apart and usually I can put most of them back together again.

Why not check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/ste2425) to see what I'm working on or my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_s_cooper) if you want to say hi?

# Personal Projects

I've built a number of personal projects in the past (some much worse than others)

### PSP Consolizer

A project using an `Arduino nano 33 IOT` to turn a PSP into a games console that can use Bluetooth based controllers.

### PSP Consolizer Installer

An electron app to provide users of my PSP Consolizer a single click installer to program their Arduino and flash the NINA firmware. All without needing to install the Arduino IDE or any other tools.
