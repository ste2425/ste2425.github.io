The end goal was always for it to be internal to the PSP but there was so much I needed to learn first. Arduino dev, PCB design &amp; production etc. Figured it would be best to start easy and not have to worry about trying to cram it all into the PSP too.</p>","more":"<p>The first challenge I needed to try and solve was how to connect both the original PSP’s buttons and the Arduino to the PSP’s motherboard.</p>\n<p>The PSP (2000 in my case) uses two 10-pin and one 14-pin 0.5mm FFC connectors for its face buttons.</p>\n<p>The analog stick uses an odd surface mating situation. Similar to PS2/3 controllers it relies on metal contacts on the analog stick to touch contacts on the motherboard. I’ll need to figure out a way to work with that.</p>\n<h1 id=\"FFC-Connectors\"><a href=\"#FFC-Connectors\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"FFC Connectors\"></a>FFC Connectors</h1><p>This one seems simpler. Essentially a Y-splitter. I’m thinking, build some custom FPC’s. A male connector built into the FPC on one end and two FFC connectors on the other.</p>\n<p>Plug the male end into the motherboard, the PSP’s buttons into one FFC connector and the Arduino into the other.</p>\n<p>I can even simplify it and omit any grounds going to the Arduino.</p>\n\n  <a class=\"fancybox\" \n    href=\"/images/consolizer - making connections/left-connector.png\"\n    title=\"Left Connector\"\n  >\n    <img\n      src=\"/images/consolizer - making connections/left-connector-thumb.png\"\n      style=\"max-width: 300px\"\n      alt=\"Left Connector\" />\n  </a>\n\n  <span class=\"caption \">\n    Left Connector\n  </span>\n\n\n\n  <a class=\"fancybox\" \n    href=\"/images/consolizer - making connections/middle-connector.png\"\n    title=\"Center Connector\"\n  >\n    <img\n      src=\"/images/consolizer - making connections/middle-connector-thumb.png\"\n      style=\"max-width: 300px\"\n      alt=\"Center Connector\" />\n  </a>\n\n  <span class=\"caption \">\n    Center Connector\n  </span>\n\n\n<p>I haven’t test-fitted these yet.</p>\n<p>The plan was to print them on paper, offer it up to the motherboard and see how it fits. However, when I got my printer out it leaked ink all over my floor.</p>\n<p>Luckily I’m visiting my parents for Christmas so I’m sure they won’t mind me borrowing their printer.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Analog-Stick\"><a href=\"#Analog-Stick\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Analog Stick\"></a>Analog Stick</h1><p>The analog stick for the PSP is odd. It doesn’t mound with a FFC connector (on the 2000 anyway, the 3000 does). It instead has four gold contacts on the motherboard which press against contacts on the stick.</p>\n<p>So I need a way of intercepting these.</p>\n<p>Again a custom FPC is on the cards, this time a dual-layer one.</p>\n<p>Idea is it has contacts on both sides that will mate with the motherboard and stick. Ground and power can be directly connected but sense for the X and Y axis needs to be intercepted.</p>\n<p>This is because we either need to feed to the PSP a value from our digital potentiometer when using a controller or hook it directly to the original stick when not. If we connect both at the same time it will skew the resistance and result in a stick only operating at half its range.</p>\n<p>On the Arduino’s side I intend to use an Analog Multiplexer, which essentially acts like a switch for analog signals and will allow me to route either the digital potentiometer or the original stick to the PSP.</p>\n\n  <a class=\"fancybox\" \n    href=\"/images/consolizer - making connections/analog.png\"\n    title=\"Analog Stick FPC\"\n  >\n    <img\n      src=\"/images/consolizer - making connections/analog-thumb.png\"\n      style=\"max-width: 300px\"\n      alt=\"Analog Stick FPC\" />\n  </a>\n\n  <span class=\"caption \">\n    Analog Stick FPC\n  </span>\n\n\n<h1 id=\"Why-not-do-it-in-Software\"><a href=\"#Why-not-do-it-in-Software\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Why not do it in Software?\"></a>Why not do it in Software?</h1><p>The PSP has two interfaces an Arduino could use to talk to it in software, USB and a Serial Port exposed via the AV socket.</p>\n<p>There are also a number of projects attempting to do the same (external controllers) using these ports.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Operation-Ditto\"><a href=\"#Operation-Ditto\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Operation-Ditto\"></a>Operation-Ditto</h2><p><a href=\"https://github.com/Operation-DITTO/Operation-DITTO\">https://github.com/Operation-DITTO/Operation-DITTO</a></p>\n<p>Is a project to add a second analog stick to the PSP.

Time to see if there’s anything I can do to fit that.</p>\n\n  <a class=\"fancybox\" \n    href=\"/images/consolizer.jpg\"\n    title=\"PSP Consolizer\"\n  >\n    <img\n      src=\"/images/consolizer-thumb.jpg\"\n      style=\"max-width: 300px\"\n      alt=\"PSP Consolizer\" />\n  </a>\n\n  <span class=\"caption \">\n    PSP Consolizer\n  </span>","more":"<h1 id=\"The-problem\"><a href=\"#The-problem\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The problem\"></a>The problem</h1><p>So the PSP’s clock is maintained by its battery however there is also a supercapacitor that keeps time too. Whilst this looks suspiciously like a cell battery it’s not. According to members of the PSP Homebrew Discord (cracking place by the way), <a href=\"https://uk.farnell.com/panasonic/eecen0f204ak/cap-0-2f-3-3v-double-layer-smd/dp/1305070\">this is the capacitor</a>.</p>\n\n  <a class=\"fancybox\" \n    href=\"/images/before.jpg\"\n    title=\"PSP Super Capacitor\"\n  >\n    <img\n      src=\"/images/before-thumb.jpg\"\n      style=\"max-width: 300px\"\n      alt=\"PSP Super Capacitor\" />\n  </a>\n\n  <span class=\"caption \">\n    PSP Super Capacitor\n  </span>\n\n\n<p>The problem I have is rather unique though. My Consolized PSP runs without its battery. This means every time I disconnected the mains power (don’t like leaving it on wasting power when not in use) the date and time are lost.</p>\n<p>I’m not sure how long the capacitor is intended to hold its charge. On mine, it resets after a few minutes. You could buy external chargers where you removed the PSP’s battery and charged in them. Did Sony expect the capacitor to hold for hours whilst you charged the battery in an external charger?</p>\n\n  <a class=\"fancybox\" \n    href=\"/images/batteryCharger.png\"\n    title=\"Official Sony External Battery Charger\"\n  >\n    <img\n      src=\"/images/batteryCharger.png\"\n      style=\"max-width: 300px\"\n      alt=\"Official Sony External Battery Charger\" />\n  </a>\n\n  <span class=\"caption \">\n    Official Sony External Battery Charger\n  </span>\n\n\n<h1 id=\"The-Solution\"><a href=\"#The-Solution\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Solution\"></a>The Solution</h1><p>I figured if the purpose of the capacitor is to hold the time in between changing the PSP’s battery could I not hook up a coin cell to it instead: <em>SPOILER ALERT</em> the answer is yes.</p>\n<p>Looking at the datasheet above the capacitor is rated at 3.3v. Trouble is that is the upper limit, the PSP could run at 3v, 1.9v or 3.3v.</p>\n<p>Just so happened I was wandering around Aldi and spotted some 3v cell batteries on the last chance saloon aisle next to the tills. Figured, sod it that would be good enough.</p>\n\n  <a class=\"fancybox\" \n    href=\"/images/supercapacitor.png\"\n    title=\"Super Capacitor\"\n  >\n    <img\n      src=\"/images/supercapacitor.png\"\n      style=\"max-width: 300px\"\n      alt=\"Super Capacitor\" />\n  </a>\n\n  <span class=\"caption \">\n    Super Capacitor\n  </span>\n\n\n<p>Next i would need to stop the PSP from attempting to charge the battery, luckily I had some spare diodes from an old electronics starter kit.</p>\n<p>So the plan;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>solder some jumper leads to the battery</li>\n<li>solder a diode to stop the PSP charging the battery</li>\n<li>Desolder the super capacitor</li>\n<li>Solder the battery jumper leads in place</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Easy right?</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n      <h3 id=\"Soldering-to-batteries-is-stupid-don’t-do-it\"><a href=\"#Soldering-to-batteries-is-stupid-don’t-do-it\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Soldering to batteries is stupid, don’t do it.\"></a>Soldering to batteries is stupid, don’t do it.</h3><p>You can buy cell batteries with tabs (like for GameBoy games) or little holders. Use one of them.</p>\n\n      </div>\n\n<p>Firstly I soldered up the battery. Using lots of flux and little contact time with the battery. Once done I wrapped it in some heat shrink.</p>\n\n  <a class=\"fancybox\" \n    href=\"/images/cell.jpg\"\n    title=\"Soldered battery\"\n  >\n    <img\n      src=\"/images/cell-thumb.jpg\"\n      style=\"max-width: 300px\"\n      alt=\"Soldered battery\" />\n  </a>\n\n  <span class=\"caption \">\n    Soldered battery\n  </span>\n\n\n<p>Next was soldering the diode.</p>\n<p>Diodes only allow current to flow in one direction, allowing the battery to discharge whilst preventing the PSP from charging it. Diodes incur a voltage drop across them. Measuring the battery without a load I got 3.25v, measuring with the diode I got 2.8v.</p>\n<p>Different diodes may be marked differently. Mine had a white band to indicate the cathode.</p>\n<p>This is a rather crude diagram of how I wired it up.</p>\n\n  <a class=\"fancybox\" \n    href=\"/images/wiring.png\"\n    title=\"Wiring Diagram\"\n  >\n    <img\n      src=\"/images/wiring.png\"\n      style=\"max-width: 300px\"\n      alt=\"Wiring Diagram\" />\n  </a>\n\n  <span class=\"caption \">\n    Wiring Diagram\n  </span>\n\n\n<p>Lastly, I needed to remove the old capacitor and solder in my battery.</p>\n<p>Using the correct soldering iron tip will help a lot here. Luckily I could swap mine out for a larger tip to heat a larger area. The metal tabs of the capacitor act like heatsinks and will quickly absorb the heat.</p>\n<p>The small pointed tips on the average soldering iron may struggle to heat the area well enough to remove the capacitor without damaging the PSP.</p>\n<p>Once removed soldering in the battery was quite easy.</p>\n\n  <a class=\"fancybox\" \n    href=\"/images/after.jpg\"\n    title=\"Soldered battery\"\n  >\n    <img\n      src=\"/images/after-thumb.jpg\"\n      style=\"max-width: 300px\"\n      alt=\"Soldered battery\" />\n  </a>\n\n  <span class=\"caption \">\n    Soldered battery\n  </span>\n\n\n<p>Just like that, job done.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n      <h3 id=\"Overvoltage\"><a href=\"#Overvoltage\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Overvoltage\"></a>Overvoltage</h3><p>When I measured the PSP’s super capacitor I read 1.9v. This cell is powering the PSP with 2.8v. I have no idea if my capacitor was dying and was undervolting the PSP. I could also be running it at too high a voltage which could cause long term damage.
